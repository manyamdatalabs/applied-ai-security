# xperiment

This folder contains my **hands-on projects and proof-of-concepts (POCs)**.

Each project here is focused on solving a small, practical problem using a mix of:

- Security fundamentals  
- DevOps / automation practices  
- AI or LLM-based enhancements  

The goal is not to build perfect products, but to **apply what I learn in a real, usable way**.

Each project typically includes:
- Source code  
- Configuration files  
- Sample data  
- Basic documentation  

This is where learning turns into **practical experience**.
