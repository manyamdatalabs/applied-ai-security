# xtract

This folder contains the **presentation layer** of my work.

Here, I organize and summarize the outcomes of my experiments so they are easy to understand and share.

You’ll find:
- Project READMEs  
- Architecture diagrams  
- Demo screenshots  
- Key learnings and summaries  

The purpose of this folder is to **extract value** from my hands-on work and present it clearly for others.

This is where technical work becomes **communicable and useful**.
