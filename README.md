# applied-ai-security

This repository is my personal learning and experimentation space where I focus on **applying AI to real-world Cybersecurity, DevSecOps, and Cloud Security problems**.

My approach is simple:  
**learn the fundamentals, build small practical solutions, and document the outcomes clearly.**

This repo reflects how I think about security, automation, and the role of AI in modern engineering teams.

## How This Repo Is Organized

I follow a 3-part structure to keep learning, building, and presentation clearly separated.

### xplore  
This folder contains my **learning material** – notes, PDFs, and references related to:

- DevOps (Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD, Cloud etc)  
- Cybersecurity (Vulnerability Management, AppSec, Threat Modeling etc)  
- Generative AI (LLMs, RAG, embeddings, API integrations etc)  

This is where I focus on **understanding the concepts**.

---

### xperiment  
This folder contains my **hands-on projects and proof-of-concepts (POCs)**.

Each project combines:
- Security fundamentals  
- Automation / DevOps practices  
- AI or LLM-based enhancements  

This is where I **apply what I learn to practical problems**.

---

### xtract  
This folder contains the **presentation layer** of my work:

- Project READMEs  
- Architecture diagrams  
- Demo screenshots  
- Key learnings  

This is where I **summarize and communicate** my work clearly for others.

## Why I Built This Repo

My goal is to create a **structured, practical portfolio** that shows:

- How I approach security challenges  
- How I use automation effectively  
- How AI can be applied in a responsible, useful way  

This repository is not about flashy demos.  
It’s about **consistent learning, clean documentation, and real-world relevance**.

## What You’ll Find Here Over Time

- AI-assisted vulnerability scanning experiments  
- DevSecOps automation workflows  
- Cloud security and IAM use cases  
- Applied LLM use cases for security teams  
- Clear, well-documented technical projects

## About Me

I work at the intersection of **AI, cloud, and cybersecurity**, focusing on building practical, secure solutions for real-world enterprise environments.

My background includes DevOps, platform engineering, and security, and I am particularly interested in how Generative AI can be integrated into existing systems in a reliable, responsible, and scalable way.

I enjoy working on:

- AI-assisted security and automation
- Cloud and DevSecOps workflows
- Designing solutions that are both technical and user-focused

This repository reflects my approach to learning and building:
clear thinking, hands-on experimentation, and a strong emphasis on practical impact and security awareness.
