# AI-Security-Ops

This repository is my personal learning space where I document my daily progress in:

- Cybersecurity  
- Generative AI  
- DevSecOps / Cloud / Automation  

I upload:
- My handwritten notes (PDF)
- Practice exercises
- Code samples
- Screenshots from VS Code / terminal

The idea is simple:  
Learn consistently, practice daily, and track real progress.
